# Self-Study Guide for ML and Deep Learning

A no-bullshit personal guide that assumes competence in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and machine-learning basics.

Notes:
- DL subcategories, as stated by [Andrew Ng's Nuts and Bolts of Applying Deep Learning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ka6a13S9I):
  1. General DL - RBF networks, feed-forward dense networks
  2. 1D recurrent models -  RNNs (recurrent neural networks), LSTMs
  3. Image stuff (2D/3D) - CNNs
  4. Other - GANs(Generative Adversarial Networks)

## Notes & Misc.
- Todo: to get a deep understanding of algorithms, implement them from scratch (start w/ logistic regression & k-means, work to more complicated & interesting algorithms)
- More data beats a smarter algorithm every time.
